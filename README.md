# InteractiveRoboticsResearch
My Fall 2022 Undergraduate Research Opportunities Project in the Interactive Robotics and Vision Laboratory. I developed a new LED gaze cue display to help divers communicate with the robot in a visual light based manner. The LEDs are Adafruit neopixels daisy chained together, and driven by light activation arrays from the raspberry pi.
